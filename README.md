## *Description:*

#### Building out a e-commerce site for the launch of my eyelash extension brand. Eyelash extensions have blown up over the years. Getting them done professional can be pricey and could take a couple hours to apply. Having an option to do this in the comfort of your own home without any prior experience. This lash method is applied safely under the eyeslashes, sitting snug between both the water line and beginning of the lash. The adhesive to hold these extensions to your natrual lash is a tradional spoolie brush applicator. This process is a user friendly application that can be applied in minutes and for a fraction of the price. - This site will contain a landing page, product page, about page, checkout page, how-to and AR try on.
